# Rama Event Processor\n\nThis repository demonstrates how to use Rama from RedPlanetLabs to process events in a distributed, scalable way.\n\n## What is Rama?\n\nRama is a programming platform that integrates and generalizes data ingestion, processing, indexing, and querying. It allows you to build scalable backends with significantly less code than traditional approaches.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Clone this repository\n2. Install Rama following the instructions at https://redplanetlabs.com/learn-rama\n3. Build the project using Maven or Gradle\n4. Run the example to see event processing in action\n\n## Features\n\n- Event ingestion through depots\n- Distributed processing with stream topologies\n- State management with PStates\n- Scalable architecture that can handle millions of events\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```java\n// Create a client to connect to the Rama cluster\nRamaClient client = new RamaClient(\"localhost\", 10000);\n\n// Append an event to the depot\nMap<String, Object> event = new HashMap<>();\nevent.put(\"id\", \"event-123\");\nevent.put(\"data\", \"Sample event data\");\nevent.put(\"timestamp\", System.currentTimeMillis());\n\nclient.append(\"EventProcessorModule\", \"*events\", event);\n```
